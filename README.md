# NPCGen

This is a Non Player Character (NPC) generator for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. I've been wanting to do this as a project for a while.
As a Dungeon Master, I often found that my players would exhaust my pre-made list of names quickly, and then I would have to improvise 
(with varying results). So, I decided to create this, to help out DMs like myself, and allow us to focus on improvising fun backstories for
characters, rather than trying to remember what race/class combinations we've used recently, and trying not to repeat the same names a 
bunch of times. 

This project is still in its beginning stages, and I am nowhere near an experienced programmer, so everything here (including this README)
is probably my first attempt at that particular thing. 

## Features

Right now, running the program will prompt you with a window that gives you some options, and a button that says "Generate NPC". The 
options are only there for future features, they don't actually change anything right now. 

## Running

I've only ever run this in Eclipse on my machine, so other than downloading the source code and opening it as an Eclipse project, I don't 
know how you would install it. The file that you want to run as a "Java Application" in Eclipse is Runner.java in the "gui" folder. 

## Coming Soon

There's a ton that I want to add, but the main features I want to add right now are:
* A functional (but definitely not pretty) GUI
* More customization options, so you can specify a race or a class before randomizing the rest

## Author

So far, the only contributor to this project is Daniel Ritchie.
